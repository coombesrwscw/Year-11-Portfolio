    <!-- Overview -->
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>For this project, our class made some low poly characters in blender. I am hoping that my character -whose name is Faugun Naâ€™Gattl, will appeal to people who like the union and contrast of dark, grungy, distopian things paired with colourful plants and creatures. To fulfill this idea, I have made my character a demi-kirin warrior, who existance is only for the sake of protecting nature. When my character was a chlid, however, their village was razed to the ground by a group of wandering dark artificers. Faugun was the only survivor, and the artificers experimented heaviliy upon them, replacing thier limbs and some of thier organs with destructive prosthetics. Eventually, Faugun escaped, and now it is thier goal to save the wilds from the artificers' horrible machinations.</p>

    <h2>Implications</h2>
    <h3>Asthetics</h3>
    <p>I will try to keep a theme of balance & war between technology and nature by making about half of the character look robotic/weaponized, and making the other half look natural, and texturing it with things in keeping with the theme. (e.g. bark, bone, leaves, ect...)</p>
    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <p>I will try to double check every time I make an edit to the design, and I will do this by making a habit of at least checking my changes at the end of each editing session.</p>
    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>I will try to make sure that my character is easy to use by making sure that the rigging is simple and easy to understand, and that the model is not too heavy on the computer.</p>
