    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>For this project, our class made some low poly characters in blender. I am hoping that my character -whose name is Faugun Naâ€™Gattl, will appeal to people who like the union and contrast of dark, grungy, distopian things paired with colourful plants and creatures. To fulfill this idea, I have made my character a demi-kirin warrior, who existance is only for the sake of protecting nature. When my character was a chlid, however, their village was razed to the ground by a group of wandering dark artificers. Faugun was the only survivor, and the artificers experimented heaviliy upon them, replacing thier limbs and some of thier organs with destructive prosthetics. Eventually, Faugun escaped, and now it is thier goal to save the wilds from the artificers' horrible machinations.</p>
